# How never ever to have a code limit

Did you notice that some people by just looking at the problem,
 do know which algorithm they should use to solve it?


 Today we will disscuss how you can do it too.
 All you need to do, is to **pay attention to constrains**.


 Algorithms are not inherently good or bad. 
 They are only so, then you know what kind of input you need to deal with.

 Let's learn some back of the napkins calculations you can do, to estimate your running time.

 ## One number to remember - `10^9`

All you're gonna do is to remember one number.
`10^9`.

This is an approximate amount of operations your **computer is able to do per second**.
That's why processor frequency is measured in **Gigahertz**. Giga prefix exactly means `10^9`.

Of course, it has a constant associated with it.

It's not exactly `10^9`, but approximately it is. `C * 10^9`.


## How to estimate running time using constrains

Let's take a sample leetcode problem.

### [Two sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

#### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

Even before you start thinking about the algorithm,
 this constrains give you a hint of which solution would be acceptable.
1 second is usually a limit, coding platforms set for their submissions.
So counting on the fact that you can do approximately `10^9` operations per second,
if your input size is `10^4` and your algorithm is quadratic, you will need ` ~ (10^4)^2 = 10^8` operations.
Since `10^8 < 10^9` this algorithm would be accepted by the platform. 
I think that's exactly why this problem is easy - even quadratic algorithm produces well enougth answer.

### [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest
*substring*
without duplicate characters.

#### Constraints:

   -  `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`

Here, if we go with quadratic algoritm, you will need to do `(5 * 10^4)^2 = 25 * 10^8 = 2,5 * 10^9` operations.
You can see that with `10^9` operations per second,  `2,5 * 10^9` would take you `2,5` seconds. 
So quadratic algorithm will guarantee you a time limit.

On the other hand, `O(n log n)` algorithm or `O(n)` algorithm will go just fine:
```
5 * 10^4 * log (5 * 10^4) ~ 2,3 * 10^5
```

As `2,3 * 10^5` is much less than `10^9`.

This problem is medium - simplest solution would not pass the bar.

It's useful when you are solving problems on leetcode or trying to score in the contest, but is it useful in a real interview setting?

Well, yes!

## How to use this during coding interview

### Coding assesments

t's useful knowledge for Coding Assesments
 where you need to impress the system, and not the human.

### Always ask about constrains during the coding interview

- How long this input array is expected to be?
- How many times we expect this function to be called?

Helps you to put your interviewing question in context
 and help you prioritize the right things.
