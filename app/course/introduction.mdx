# Who is this course for? What are we gonna do?
Hi, hello happy to see you here, on this course about Algorithms and Data Structures. I am your teacher. My name is Ava.

## Who is Ava?

I was teaching algorithms and data structures for 3 years now. I had tons of students. I've been lucky to been interacting with most awesome people as my students and I've helped them to get offers from Google, Amazon and similar companies. As for myself, I was working at Google and contributing to open source, such as Mozilla Firefox, which is the project I'm really proud of.  I'm trying to mix doing software engineering and teaching computer science together, to bring this course for you.

This is for everyone who wants to enjoy coding interviews

I really enjoyed preparing for my interviews. So when first a colleague told me that they dreaded the interviews, that it was such an experience they really not looking forward to, I was so surprised and I wondered why. And I really wanted to change that and I want to change it with you. If you are for some reason you feel like you need a foundation in computer science, in algorithms, if you don't feel confident during the interviews, if you feel like you're missing the building blocks, this is the course for you. We could build these building blocks together.

## What are we going to do?

See the full plan here: https://ava-coding.com/lessons/

### Time and Space Complexity

We would start with very basics, with Time and Space complexity. What is the definition and how you can intuitively think about it. 

When I would answer the hot question: What the heck is logarithm? :) You'll make sense of constructions like O(log n) and O(n log n) and learn to think about them like a Computer Scientist. 

### Strings and arrays manipulation

First stop: strings and arrays. We would look at arrays and strings and it's implementations in different languages and how they map to actual memory of the computer. We would look on some interesting (and tricky!) tasks using strings and arrays.

### Linked lists, stacks, queues and deques

Next stop: linked lists. Once you know them and arrays, you could implement stacks and queues in no time! We would compare different implementations and decide (secretly) which one is the best one.

### Trees 

Then, we would look at the trees, what is really a tree and most common algorithms to traverse it: DFS and BFS. We would create simple and elegant code to do both. Most important, you will be able to recognize which one you should be using in particular situation. 

### Graphs

Finally, we would come to graphs and generalize many things we have been learning so far. You would use simple algorithms like DFS and BFS to solve most common graph problems, and create more advanced algorithms, like cycle detection, topological sort and Dijkstra. 

### Combine it all together

The final goal for you, of course, is to have arrays, trees and graphs in your pocket to solve any problem, however complex it might be. And you will learn and appreciate Computer Science concepts all around you, in your daily job as a Software Engineer!

## How the course is structured

Every lecture in the course consists of 3 things:

- Short video 5-7mins, which you can watch from your mobile

- A post, covering in text the same concepts we have discussed in the video

- LinkedIn Group, where you can submit the questions about the topic.

I would really look for all of your questions before the videos and try to address them as much as I could in my videos. I really want for it to be back and forth conversation while I'm preparing the videos and you are bringing me questions!

The new video / post would be released every week on Sunday.

So join the LinkedIn Group, if it's comfortable for you to follow there otherwise you can subscribe in email, and receive new lectures in your inbox. Whatever works for you!

## I'm waiting for you to ace algorithms!

The course is absolutely free to join. It is self-guided and would require structure and effort from you to make it work and learn. But all the materials would be freely available. 

It has been a dream of mine for long to create something like this and yeah, let's go!
