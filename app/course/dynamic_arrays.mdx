## Dynamic arrays and amortized constant

I bet you love dynamic arrays. Those are arrays that could **grow or shrink in size, fitting exactly your needs**.
You don't need to know in advance how many elements exactly you would need.


> But how is it possible, knowing what you know of [memory of the computer](../../chapter/time_and_space/static_arrays)? 

Under the hood, we still use static arrays and allocate new memory.

But how to make operations *efficient*? 

Let's talk about the most common operation: **adding element to the end of the array**.

## Push back / Append

If every time that we need to append to the end we would require new memory,
 this operation would be linear.
We could NOT just place a new element where our previous elements are. 
We would need to reallocate all the elements to the new place.
That sounds painful and not efficient.

Let's be smarter. How much memory we would need, we don't know.
But let's allocate some extra memory, just in case we will grow.
How much extra memory? Let's try twice as much as was asked for.

### Let's allocate *current capacity * 2* each time:

1. `1st` element added: `2` elements allocated
1. `2nd` element added: no move needed, just add to the free space
1. `3rd` element added: allocate space for `2 * 2 = 4` elements, move `2` elements, add 3rd.
1. `4th` element added: no move needed, just add to the free space
1. `5th` element added: allocate space for `4 * 2 = 8`, move `4` elements, add `5th`.
1. `6th` element added: no move needed, just add to the free space
1. `7th` element added: no move needed, just add to the free space
1. `8th` element added: no move needed, just add to the free space

You can see that on some steps we did constant operation,
 and on some steps we did linear operations, comparable to the size of the array.

Is it efficient?

Well, at least it seems more efficient than reallocating space each time.

Actually, if you count the **price of operation on average**, it's *constant*.

It's called **"amortized constant"**.

But how could it be constant, if we just saw that **sometimes it's linear**?

## Proof that pushback operation is constant on average

Let's prove it, using the **"Banker's method"**

- Pay slightly more for a cheap operation
- Save operations as "tokens"
- Use this token to pay later for expensive operations

Prepay **3 coins** for each **insertion**
- 1 coin is raw cost of insertion
- Other 2 coins are saved :
    - Place 1 coin on the item
    - Place 1 coin on the item, which is (capacity / 2) elements prior

If we never spend more coins than we are supposed to, we have proven it.

### Let's see how it works in an example:

In the beginning we have an array of capacity 1.


#### Insert 1st element ⏹

 Pay 3 coins 🟡 🟡 🟡
- One coin 🟡 spent on "inserting".
- One coin 🟡 sits on the element.
- One coin 🟡 would get on element `(1 / 2)` before, this time it's wasted 🗑.

      alt="Insert new element into a dynamic array"
/>


#### Insert 2nd element ⏹

There is nowhere to insert it, because the capacity of the array is 1.
So we would spend the 🟡 coin on `1` to reallocate the array to the new place with `capacity * 2 = 2` elements.

Pay 3 coins 🟡 🟡 🟡
- One coin 🟡 spent on "inserting" `2`.
- One coin 🟡 sits on the element `2`.
- One coin 🟡 would get on element `(capacity / 2)` before, so on element `1`.

#### Insert 3rd element ⏹.
There is nowhere to insert it, but whole array is **"prepaid"**,
 so we can reallocate it to a new place with `capacity * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4`.

Pay 3 coins 🟡 🟡 🟡.
- One coin 🟡 spent on "inserting" `3`.
- One coin 🟡 sits on the element `3`.
- One coin 🟡 goes to `4 / 2` elements before, so to `1`.

Now both `1` and `3` has coins 🟡 🟡.

#### Insert 4th element ⏹.

Pay 3 coins 🟡 🟡 🟡

- One coin 🟡 spent on "inserting" `4`.
- One coin 🟡 sits on the element `4`.
- One coin 🟡 goes to `4 / 2` elements before, so to `2`.

#### Insert 5th element ⏹. 
There is nowhere to insert it, but whole array is "prepaid",
 so we can reallocate it to a new place with `capacity * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`.

Pay 3 coins 🟡 🟡 🟡
- One coin 🟡 spent on "inserting" `5`.
- One coin 🟡 sits on the element `5`.
- One coin 🟡 goes to `8 / 2` elements before, so to `1`.

- One coin 🟡 sits on the element `6`.
- One coin 🟡 goes to `8 / 2` elements before, so to `2`.

You noticed that **array again gets "prepaid" so we can move it**?
So per each item we pay no more than 3 🟡 🟡 🟡 coins, which transfers to mean `3 operations`.
We never do more than `n * 3` operations, while we insert `n` elements into the array.


> That proves that on average, a push back is an `O(n * 3) / n = O(1)` - constant operation

If you think of regular life, there is a similar concept:

## Daily cost of product use

Concept of amortized constant is similar to calculating price **"per usage"** of something.
If you bought `1000$` laptop, and you use for `3` years - `1000$ / 365 * 3 ~ 1$`,
 laptop actually costs you about `a dollar per day` 

But if you bought a fancy `300$` yearly adobe subscription, and you've used `10` times - it's `30$ per usage`.
So having adobe subscription is **more expensive per usage** than buying a new laptop.
