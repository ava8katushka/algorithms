# Computer memory

## How does computer store our data?

When you writing a program, and allocating an array, hashtable or a variable, where does this memory come from? 

- How is it accessesed? 

- And why there is a limit? 

- Why certain things happen very fast while others take more time? 

To understand that, we need to get familiar with **computer memory** and how it operates.

There are few layers you should now about.

### Registers

This is memory **used directly in CPU**. If you do any operations in your code,
 those operations happen here.
`Processor` could load a piece of memory to `register`, store the result,
 move it from one `register` to an other, do simple math or logical operations.
 Billions of these operations happen per second. 
`Registers` are **smallest pieces of memory** in the computer, holding `8`, `16`, `32`, or `64 bits`.

### CPU Cache (L1, L2, L3)

`Cache` tries to *predict* next piece of information needed by `CPU`.
This is **a buffer between Registers and RAM**. 
It's located close to the `registers`, so grabbing memory from here will only take computer `2-10 nanoseconds`.
`Caches` slightly bigger than `Registers`, hold up to a **few megabytes of data**:

1. Closest **L1 cache** could hold `16KB` to `128KB` per core
2. **L2 cache** can range from `256KB` to `1MB` per core or be shared
3. **L3 cache** is typically shared among all cores and can range from `2MB` to `32MB` or more in high-end processors

Typically data that goes in cache is data which was stored close together
 in `RAM`. Each cache has it's *Cache line* size which grabs not only what
  processor would need right now, but **also what lies close** and fits into
   *Cache line*.

### RAM - Random Access Memory

This is main and **biggest working memory** of the computer! 
This is there your program lives. And any other programs that computer 
is running. When you shut down your computer, **RAM** clears up,
 as there are no more programs running.

Common sizes of `RAM` include `4GB`, `8GB`, `16GB`, `32GB`, and `64GB`, with some high-end systems offering `128GB` or more.

The computer where I run this text right now - Macbook Air - has `8GB` of RAM.
When processor tries to access memory located here,
 it could take it up to `100 nanoseconds`.

 You can see that travelling to **cache is 10 times faster**, than grabbing something from RAM.

 ### SSD - Solid State Drive

 This is the first memory on this list which is actually **long-term memory**! 
 
- It's persistent and permanent.
- It doesn't clear up when your computer shuts down or reloads.
- It keeps the information safely.

But reading something from here could take up to `15 000 nanoseconds`. 
It is **150 times slower than from RAM**!

But SSD could be quite big from `120GB` to over `30TB`!

My computer has exactly `120GB`. 

### HDD - Hard Disk Drive

Disks are quite **budget-friendly** long-term storage solution for big amounts of data.

But access to them could take `10 000 000 nanoseconds`, which is almost **1000 slower than SSD**.

It's ideal for **back-up storage** and **large media libraries**.


## So what happens if I allocate memory inside my program?

- Memory you have allocated would live in **RAM, while your program runs**.

- When you do any **operations**, it gets into **CPU registers** and **cache**.

- When you want to create an **array of data**, a block of **sequential memory** is given to you.

First arrays were static, it means they could not change in size. If you create array of 10 elements, *memory exactly fitting this information* is given.


But what if you want to store more data in your array?

What happens with memory?

As memory for array must be sequential, *new space in memory would be found to fit grown array*.

So the memory would be **reallocated**. 

As you know it's quite an **expensive operation**.

That's why Computer Scientists have created a trick how not to do this expensive operation very often - [dynamic arrays](../../chapter/time_and_space/dynamic_arrays).
