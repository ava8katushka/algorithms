Introduction

Who is this course for and what are we gonna do

Time & Space Complexity

What is time and space complexity, exactly?

Fairy Code Mother: How to never have a code limit 

What is a logarithm?

How to make sense of O(1), O(n), O(n log n), O(a^n) and similar

Computer memory and static arrays

Dynamic arrays and amortized constant

Design thinking: which algorithm is better

Arrays & Strings manipulation

Move the zeros: metaphor of memory management

Don't do this to strings! Or how your O(n) algorithm is suddenly O(n^2)

Let's add some space and save some time: concept of prefix sums

Apply concept of prefix sums to save the day

Linked lists

Why do we even need linked lists?

Doubly linked list vs Singly linked list

Reverse linked list

Sum of two numbers

Detection of a cycle

This complex problem is actually 3 simple problems

Binary Search

Why log(n) complexity is super freaking cool

Recursive algorithm vs iterative algorithm

Simple algorithm but the devil in the details

Binary search in a broken array

Find a single entry in an array of duplicates

Stacks, Queues and Dequeues

What is a stack, exactly? And why should I care?

How you can implement a stack: linked list vs dynamic array

Classic stack: valid parenthesis

Classic stack: calculator

Favorite past time: standing in the queue

How an intelligent person could implement a queue

Typewriter task

Best of the both worlds: the dequeue

And now we are capable enough to the LRU: Least Recently Used cache!

You Majesty, the Hashtable

Key value store: this might be the most useful thing EVER

What exactly hashing is? Could I be stupid while doing it? (yes you can!)

Miracles of modular arithmetic

90% of students struggle with that: big numbers are not your friends or how avoid Time Limit

Implement hashtable with linked lists

Implement hashtable with open hashing

The non-zero cost of using a hashtable

Trees are your friends

I've never seen a tree in my computer. Or had I?

What exactly Software Engineers mean when they talk about a tree

Binary Search Trees: embodiment of Binary Search

Navigating a tree: Depth First Search

Navigating a tree: Breadth First Search

Trie: how to store a dictionary

Smart trees: Red-black Tree & AVL

Everything is a graph

Graphs are hot: and that's why

3 ways to store a graph

DFS on a graph

Max area of the island

Is graph bipartite? 

BFS on a graph

How do I know is it DFS or BFS?

Finding the shortest path

More on Graphs

Detecting a cycle in a graph

Topological sort: Making a schedule or how I should dress tonight

Khan's algorithm

DFS algorithm

Dijkstra: it's just BFS with a priority queue
