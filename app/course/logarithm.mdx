If you type the definition of logarithm in Google, it spits out something unhelpful, like:
> a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.

Don't blame yourself if you struggle with remembering it.

The fact is, nobody in Computer Science things of algorithm like that.

## Practical use of binary search
If you think your knowledge of logarithmic algorithms is useless, think again.
