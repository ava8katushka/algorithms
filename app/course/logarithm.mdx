# What is a logarithm?

If you type the definition of **logarithm** in `Google`, it spits out something *unhelpful*, like:
> a quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.

Don't blame yourself if you struggle with remembering it.

The fact is, **nobody in Computer Science thinks of logarithm like that**.

So, how do they think about it?

Well, as a **tree height**...

Don't kill me. Let me explain.

## What tree are we talking about?

Are Computer Scientists insane? No. We are just imaginitive. 

### Binary search tree

We can think of sorted array as a tree.
Every element of an array is a node. Middle of the array is the root.
Then all the elements left to the node is *smaller than it*. 
Every element to the right of the node is *larger than it*.

Every node has **at most two children**.

Nodes that have *no children*, we would call **leaves**.

For example, sorted array  `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 23, 55, 80, 111, 300, 901]`
 in the tree form could look like this:

      width={400}
      height={300}
      alt="Time and space complexity poster"
/>

Does it look like a tree to you? Well, it's **upside down**, to begin with.
 But you can see root, branches, leaves - now you can see the tree!

In fact, as long as we follow the rule **"all to the left - smaller, all to the right - larger"**, *even this construction* could call itself a tree:

      width={400}
      height={300}
      alt="Time and space complexity poster"qs
/>

This one, is, in fact, **unbalanced**.

Let's look at the height of this tree.

Height of the tree is the length shortest path from the root to one of the leaves.
It correspons to your *intuition* of what the heigh of the tree would be.

For example, height of this tree of 15 elements is 4:

      width={500}
      height={400}
      alt="Tree with height of 4"
/>

Here the tree has 31 elements, and the height is just 5:

      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ava-coding-com/image/upload/v1744747528/Algorithms%20Book/Tree_Larger_1_1_xn9jww.png"
      width={500}
      height={400}
      alt="Tree with height of 5"
/>

And if the double the elements again, the tree height increases **just by one**:
this tree has 63 elements and the height of 6.

      width={500}
      height={400}
      alt="Tree with height of 6"
/>

Isn't that increadible? Our tree is so large, but the height is still pretty small!
In fact, it's just **one unit higher than the tree with just half of it's elements**.

Funny, right? This tree height grows very slow.

**So the height of this tree is indeed logarithm.**

No panic! You weren't scared before, right?  It's just one pretty tree.

So if the tree has `n` nodes, the height is approximately `log₂n`.

For this definition to work, we need the tree to be `balanced` - so any one part is not much larger than an other. 

But you got it! **Logarithm is just a height of the tree.**


Exhale. Nothing scary. Even nothing much mathematical. 
Draw this tree to your math teacher. Log is literal log! xD
They might just love it :D 

## log₃n, log₁₀n and other logs

Why `log₂n` you might ask. Very simple: are nodes had **at most two children**.
If we draw ourselves a tree and allow each node to have 3 children, the height of this tree would be ` log₃n`:


<Image
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ava-coding-com/image/upload/v1744747529/Algorithms%20Book/Tree3_1_d68f9g.png"
      width={500}
      height={400}
      alt="Tree with height of 4 with 3 children on each node"
/>

This tree has `1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 42` nodes.

Every new level has `3 times` more nodes than one before that.

Last level, <i>leaves</i>, has more nodes, than <i>all the levels before it</i>.

1. log₃1 = 0
2. log₃3 = 1
3. log₃9 = 2
4. log₃27 = 3

So height of the tree with `n` nodes will be `height >= log₃n`.

Asymptotically, `height ~ log₃n`

And if we allow `10` children, resulting height would be around `log₁₀n`.

In fact, for us as Computer Scientists doesn't much matter, which `log` is it.

Because all of logs differ by just a constant:

      width={500}
      height={400}
      alt="loga(x) = logb(x) / logb(a)"
/>

So as long as you have a tree, you know that it's height is a logarithm. 

Most commonly when talking about logarithms, Computer Scientists assume **logarithm of two**.
So you might skip saying `log two of an`. Say just `log an`!

You are all set now to use logarithms at full speed! It's not a nightmare - it's just a log!
