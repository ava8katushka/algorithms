# About author

Hello my Dears,

My name is Ava Katushka. I'm a woman Software Engineer.
In school I was drawn to solving olympiad math problems. I found them facinating.
In the university, I got a strong urge to travel the world, but I got no money. 
I found there is actually a way to travel, and in fact they will pay you - it's called an internship.
I googled how to get an internship. I found articles by Lara describing step by step process of getting internship at Google, and I got envolved.
It took me almost a year to prepare, few desperate Linkedin reach-outs, considerations of different companies, english courses, hours of interview preparation - 
and I realized my dream - I got internship in Google New York.

To tell the truth, it was very fun time in my life and I like the preparation process with all of my heart.
Later, I was working in Google, Munich, Germany, and I heard that many of my collegues dreaded the interview.
When I thought that I might be found my nishe: 
if I can share with them how fun and exciting preparation to interview can be, they will stop dread it or try to avoid it - they would get excited!

Few years after I was coaching in a few companies helping people with their coding interviews - Exponent, IgotAnOffer, Yandex, Carrus. I got a lot of positive reviews and I noticed a lot of people are staggling with the same stuff.
I did almost 150+ interviews. I saw the mistakes people did over and over.

I also noticed that people who participated in competition programming while they were in education were not very welcoming to those, who didn't have this experience.
The implication was, "if you don't know that, you are stupid". I hated that. 

I wanted to create a safe space, where any question are welcome, even very stupid. You don't have to know everything beforehand. It's okay.
Your interest is encouraged. Heavy mathematical stuff is explained with simple examples. You can see in fact, that's it's not hard at all. And yes, you are smart.

You finally could start building your foundation and being confident and excited in the interview. Because at the end of the day, it is a lot of fun!
And I want your talent, especally if you are a woman, to be applied, when we build this world as Software Engineers.

As I said sometime ago, if I never saw a happy Software Engineer woman, I would vouch to be the first one. And you are welcome to join me.
