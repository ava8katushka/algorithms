# About Me

Hello, my Dears!  

I'm [Ava Katushka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-katushka-0628ab104/), a software engineer, an artist, and a self-proclaimed coding interview nerd. If you're here, you probably have some interest in tech, algorithms, or just figuring out how to survive a coding interview without losing your sanity. Good newsâ€”Iâ€™m here to help!

## How It All Started  

In school, I was that kid who actually *enjoyed* solving Olympiad math problems. I found them fascinating, like little puzzles waiting to be cracked. But university introduced me to a different passionâ€”travel. There was just one problem: I had no money. Then, I discovered a magical thing called *internships*. Turns out, not only can you travel through them, but companies will *pay* you to do so! Sign me up!

Thatâ€™s how I ended up on a wild journey: googling my way into tech, reading every article by Lara on how to get an internship at Google, and preparing like my life depended on it. It took almost a year of studying, desperate LinkedIn reach-outs, English courses, and countless interview prep sessionsâ€”but I did it! I landed a software engineering internship at Google New York.

And you know what? I *loved* the preparation process. Solving problems, learning new things, and pushing my limitsâ€”it was like my own personal Olympics. Later, when I worked at Google in Munich, I realized that many of my colleagues absolutely *dreaded* coding interviews. And thatâ€™s when it hit me: what if I could show people that interview prep could actually be *fun*?

## Building a Safe Space for Learning  

For the next few years, I coached people for coding interviews at **[Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/coaching), [IgotAnOffer](https://igotanoffer.com/), [Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.ru/algorithms/), [Carrus](https://www.carrus.io/)** and **[Verbetcetra](https://verbetcetera.com/)**. I did over 150 interviews and saw the same struggles again and again. I also noticed something frustratingâ€”people who had competitive programming backgrounds werenâ€™t always welcoming to those who didnâ€™t. The unspoken message was, *if you donâ€™t know this, you must be stupid.*

I *hated* that.

So, I decided to create a space where *all* questions are welcomeâ€”yes, even the ones you think are stupid. You donâ€™t need to know everything beforehand. You *can* learn, and you *will* get better. Complex math? Iâ€™ll break it down into simple examples. Algorithms? Weâ€™ll make them fun. And yes, you *are* smart enough.

At the end of the day, coding interviews (and coding in general) *should* be exciting! My goal is to help you feel confident, prepared, andâ€”dare I say itâ€”*enjoy* the process. And if youâ€™re a woman in tech, I especially want to see you succeed. If I had never seen a happy female software engineer, I would have vowed to become the first one. And you, my dear, are welcome to join me on this journey.

Teaching has always been my passionâ€”whether itâ€™s helping my sister, a small class, or an individual mentee. Thereâ€™s nothing more satisfying than seeing someone *get it* and feel excited about learning.

So, welcome to this space! Whether you're here to level up your coding skills, survive an interview, or just geek out about algorithms, Iâ€™m thrilled to have you. Letâ€™s make learning fun, together! ðŸš€
